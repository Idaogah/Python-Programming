    "A college admits students on the basis of their scores in a series of 5 aptitude tests. The academic performance of the admitted students is then tracked, and when they complete the first year of their academic program in college, their Grade Point Average (GPA) is recorded. A student's GPA is an indicator of his/her academic performance. Higher the GPA, the better. This exercise is conducted on one batch of students. Absolute GPA is used for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next year, the college realizes that it does not have the necessary resources to conduct all 5 aptitude tests, it decides to conduct only 1 of the 5 tests. Which of the aptitude tests would you recommend them to conduct for the next round of admissions?\n",

    "This next 5 lines of every testcase has N decimal numbers ( upto 2 decimal places) separated by a single space in each line, which is the performance of the students in the 5 aptitude tests conducted for the entrance exam.
