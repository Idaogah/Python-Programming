        "1. Initialize all distances to infinity except for the distance from s to itself, which is set to 0. Create a priority queue of vertices ordered by their distance from s, with s as the first vertex.\n",
        "2. While the priority queue is not empty, extract the vertex u with the smallest distance from s, and mark it as visited.\n",
        "3. For each neighbor v of u that is not yet visited, calculate the distance from s to v via u (i.e., the distance to u plus the weight of the edge from u to v). If this distance is smaller than the current distance to v, update the distance to v and add v to the priority queue.\n",
